# Eloquent JavaScript exercises
Welcome! This repo serves as a collection of the Eloquent JavaScript exercises ending each chapter.

**Note:** Currently only chapter 4 - *Data Structures: Objects and Arrays* has been written. As I continue reading the book I will add exercises and companion tests accordingly.

## Testing your functions
Tests are written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Install via `npm install` and then simply run all tests with `npm run test`. 

**Note:** Tests are skipped by default. To enable them open the corresponding file in the tests directory (i.e. ```./exercises/<chapter-x>.test.js```) and remove the `x` before the `describe` keyword at the start of each unit block you wish to test.  
For example lines 10, 51, and 100 of '4-data-structures.test.js'.

Happy coding!
